# MovieSense Dataset  

**MovieSense** enriches the **CMU Movie Summary Corpus** with **coreference resolution, named entities, event extraction, and commonsense inferences**. **BookNLP** resolves character references and extracts entities, while **COMET** adds causal, motivational, and future inferences, enabling **narrative analysis, character modeling, and event prediction**.  

This dataset was created during the **2024 Fall EPFL CS-401 Applied Data Analysis course** and is released under the **CC BY-SA 4.0 license**, crediting the **CMU Movie Summary Corpus**. Please use it with proper attribution.  

## Features  
- **Coreference Resolution**: Links character mentions for better entity tracking.  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracts characters, locations, and organizations.  
- **Event Extraction**: Identifies key events from movie summaries.  
- **Commonsense Inference**: Uses COMET to generate causal, motivational, and future implications.
